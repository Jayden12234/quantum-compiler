<h1>Q# compiler</h1>
<br>
<b>this is a tool for compileling MicroSoft Q# programs using DOTNET </b>
<h2>installation</h2>
<br>
<b>clone the repo into a codespace</b>
<b>to build the envioment run <br><p>sh runner.sh</p>you will only need to run this program once so it will delete after running it</b>
<h2>Random Number example</h2>
<br>
<b>the random number example to run it use dotnet run <br>it will build and run the Qrng.qs file which is Q# program for generating a random number</b>
<b>it get random values from the q# program but the c# programs puts them together into a denary number becuse q# lacks some of the tools to reason desgin it without c#</b>
<h2>entaglement example</h2>
<b>To enable entanglement, Q# provides the CNOT operation, which stands for Controlled-NOT. The result of running this operation on two qubits is to flip the second qubit if the first qubit is One.</b>


<h2>Writing Your Own Code</h2>
<b>run<br>cd qrng<br>then open the Qrng.qs file to edit your code then run dotnet run to build and run it<br>Note: it will take some time to build for the first time</b>
